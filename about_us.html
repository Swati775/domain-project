In India there are many deaths approximately more than 150000 deaths due to road accidents and this rate keeps
increasing year by year and the main reason behind this is lack of accident-prone area caution boards. So, basically 
the idea of “Road accident safety system” is to help the citizens by using a mobile application regarding safety alerts 
while moving on the road based on the location and if the accident occurs it also provides the help feature which will
send a message or call to the predetermined persons. This application shows the heat map of accident points. This Application 
works only with Mobile Data / Wi-Fi and also user needs to activate the Location / GPS Settings for getting the Accurate Point in 
the Map and also to get alert about an accident-prone area the application must be running in the foreground.
